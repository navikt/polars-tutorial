    "> Polars is a new package that is gaining a lot of attention. At the time of writing this article, it has gathered more than 1300 stars on Github, which is impressive looking at the fact that is around for less than a year. It offers almost all the functions that we need to manipulate our dataframe. Next to that, it offers a lazy API that helps us optimising our queries before we execute them. Although we didn't touch it is in this article, the benchmark of H20 shows that it is super efficient and fast. Especially with larger datasets it becomes worthwhile to look into the benefits that the lazy API has to offer.\n",

    "This is what I wrote two years ago. 1300 stars. In 2022, while I am writing this, the project has collected 10.4k stars on Github and it is number 4 trending project on Github.\n",

    "There are a lot of improvements happening under the hood and in the APIs. \n",
